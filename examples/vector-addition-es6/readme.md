# OpenCL Vector Addition ES6 DEMO

Original implementation: https://www.olcf.ornl.gov/tutorials/opencl-vector-addition/

Slightly modified version of the Vector Addition example to demonstrate how promise based asynchronous code can look in
recent version of JavaScript (like synchronous code).

Run:

Node.js 0.12+:

    node --harmony vecAddES6

io.js

    iojs vecAddES6
